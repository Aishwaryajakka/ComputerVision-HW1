* For which of the three representations is the within-between ratio smallest?
=> The Ratio of Texture Mean represenatation has the smallest ratio on within class and between class.

* Does the answer to this question depend on the value of k that you use?
=> Yes, it performed well when k=10. 

* Does it depend on the number of keypoints you extract? (Try 500, 1000, 2000, 3000.)
=> Yes, more the keypoints better the represenatation

* Which of the three types of descriptors that you used is the best one? How can you tell?
=> Texture Mean Representation has the lowest ratio between images of same class to images of different class, so it is the best descriptors.


* Is this what you expected? Why or why not?
=> I have expected Bag of words to be the best over other descriptors.
Because the Bag of words with SIFT descriptor performs the best in texture represenatation.
